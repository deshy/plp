Thorough Documentation: Detailed documentation at each phase supports maintenance, compliance, and future reference, making it ideal for regulated industries like healthcare or finance.
Predictability: With a fixed plan established upfront, Waterfall allows for more accurate timeline and budget estimates.
Disadvantages
Inflexibility: Once a phase is completed, revisiting it to accommodate changes is challenging, making Waterfall unsuitable for projects with evolving requirements.
Late Testing: Testing occurs only after implementation, meaning issues may not be discovered until late in the process, potentially increasing costs and delays.
Limited Customer Involvement: Customers see the final product only at the end, which can result in a deliverable that doesn’t fully meet their expectations.

Agile
Advantages
Flexibility: Agile easily adapts to changing requirements, making it ideal for dynamic projects where needs may shift over time.
Early and Continuous Delivery: Frequent delivery of working software allows for early testing, feedback, and refinement throughout the project.
Customer Collaboration: Regular customer involvement ensures the product aligns with their expectations and requirements.
Team Collaboration: Agile fosters close teamwork, enhancing problem-solving and innovation through constant communication.
Disadvantages
Less Predictability: The iterative nature makes it harder to forecast exact timelines and budgets, which can be a challenge for stakeholders needing firm commitments.
Lighter Documentation: Agile’s focus on working software often results in less comprehensive documentation, which may pose issues for projects requiring detailed records.
Team Dependency: Success hinges on the team’s ability to self-organize and collaborate effectively; inexperienced or disjointed teams may struggle.
Scope Creep: The flexibility to incorporate changes can lead to uncontrolled expansion of the project scope if not carefully managed.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is best for dynamic projects where requirements evolve. Example;  Developing an inventory system, where tghe requirements keep evolving with the growth of the business and feedback form the processes.

Waterfall is ideal for well-defined projects that require a structured approach. Example: Developing a government certificate printing system, where the flow is fully defined on the onset.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
i) Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance (QA) Throughout a Software Project
 Planning and Documentation:
   - Create a Quality Management Plan that details QA activities, team responsibilities, and quality standards.

Testing Strategies  
   - Unit Testing: Test individual components to confirm they work as expected.  
   - Integration Testing: Check that combined components interact correctly.  
   - System Testing: Assess the entire system to verify it meets all specified requirements.  
   - User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Involve end-users to validate that the software fulfills their needs.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)  - Adopt automated testing and deployment processes to detect issues early and maintain consistent quality across updates.
Code Reviews and Pair Programming - Conduct regular code reviews and collaborative pair programming to spot and resolve issues quickly while improving code quality.
Automated Testing Tools - Leverage tools like Selenium, JUnit, or TestNG to automate testing, improving efficiency and ensuring broader test coverage.
Performance and Security Testing  - Perform load testing, stress testing, and security audits to ensure the software operates well under pressure and remains secure.
Feedback Loops - Set up regular feedback channels with stakeholders and users to identify quality issues and address them promptly.
Training and Skill Development - Train the team in QA best practices and tools to ensure they have the skills needed to uphold high standards.
Metrics and Monitoring  - Measure key performance indicators (KPIs) such as defect density, test coverage, and mean time to resolution to track and enhance quality.
Post-Release Support - Offer ongoing maintenance and support after deployment to fix any issues that emerge and keep the software reliable.

ii) Why Maintaining High Standards Is Important
- Customer Satisfaction: High-quality software meets user expectations, boosting satisfaction and fostering loyalty.
